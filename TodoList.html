        I don't think that the human eace will survive the next
         thousand years, unless we spread into space.
          There are too many accidents that can befall
           life on a single planet. But I'm an optimist...
           My favorite place is the beach. I love the sound of the waves 
           crashing against the shore, the feel of the sand between
            my toes, and the smell of the salt air. I can spend hours
             sitting on the beach, watching the waves roll in and out.
              It's so peaceful and relaxing.
